Features

- They offer a staking service that rewards same daily rate for all NFTs.
- And for variable rewards (say based on NFT attributes) you can set reward multipliers via a script (like [this one](https://github.com/cardinal-labs/cardinal-staking/blob/e165a17fcc7b09f7fb05a506219a27596fa0ac08/tools/updateMultipliersOnRules.ts)), or you can build your own "Reward Distributor" Solana program as supported by their protocol.
- Option to hold NFT in wallet while staked.
- Token pool can be minted or in a wallet
- Open-source "Reward Distribution" and UI -- so great foundation for building your own reward systems and/or custom UI.
